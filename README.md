# Beautiful Firefox

  Basically these files were selected by me to make Mozilla Firefox a better browser.

  To use these files, firstly you need to activate this option inside "about:config" called "toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets"


  After that, you need to access "about:profiles" and click in "Open Directory" in "Root Directory".

  Then, you need to create a Directory called "chrome" and put the userChrome.css inside of it.

  Then, after restarting your Firefox, you will get the new theme.
